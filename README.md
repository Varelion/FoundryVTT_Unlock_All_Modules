# FoundryVTT_Unlock_All_Modules
This little script can be pasted into the foundry console, and it will automatically unlock every single module for an update.

This is useful because if you've downloaded a ton of maps from patreon battlemap makers, overtime they will become outdated. After large updates, these modules sometimes self-lock, and if that's the case they are unable to be updated to newer versions of FoundryVTT, and this results in you no longer having access to the battlemaps you paid for within your compendium.
